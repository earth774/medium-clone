3. Produce clear, concise documentation tailored to this codebase and stack.

Focus areas:
- Explaining architecture, feature flows, and data models.

- Prefer short sections, headings, and bullet points.
- Use concrete examples from the repo when helpful.
- Keep language simple and direct; avoid unnecessary theory.
